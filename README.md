An UNRAID system monitoring screen script, powered by Python, [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), and [psutil](https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil).
Designed to run completely in Docker, but can also be run elsewhere.
Probably using matplotlib in ways it wasn't designed for, lmao.

Based on [scripts from Adafruit](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides/tree/main/TFT_Sidekick_With_FT232H) and going overboard with the concept.

## About
This is a personal project that was meant for my personal NAS built inside a [CyberPower UPS](https://www.cyberpowersystems.com/product/ups/battery-backup/lx1500g/).
<br />
The screen (an [ILI9341](http://www.lcdwiki.com/2.8inch_SPI_Module_ILI9341_SKU:MSP2807)) is driven by an [FT232H](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2264) board with all the processing done fully with Python living inside a Docker container.

The project has undergone significant changes that have not been tracked via `git` but the end-goal has been making the main script highly fault-tolerant and passably performant under the constraints of a high-level language interacting with low-level hardware.

> [!NOTE]
> This project additionally is the author's first foray into Python programming; prior to this project I did not have any Python experience whatsoever.
With that in mind, there is potentially unrealized optimizations that can be done, but alas, as this project stands, it should work *good enough*.

### What it looks like:

    <i>neat!</i>
</div>

## Features
- Fully Python based
- Monitors the following:
    - Overall CPU load
    - CPU temp (automatically finds correct temp sensor)
    - CPU load per core (plots as a heatmap)
    - Current CPU frequency (not graphed)
    - System-wide disk activity
    - Network activity
        - NIC status (will warn if it goes down)
    - Memory usage
    - Array usage
- Small footprint: uses less than 1% CPU on most systems and runs at low-priority
- Adapts to your hardware speed and current CPU load
- Useful verbose logging and stats (user-selectable)
- "Run and done" approach
    - Run the `init.sh` file and it does the rest for you: setup, dependency updates, and more
- Fault-tolerant with clear log output on what went wrong
    - Includes numerous fallbacks for incorrect settings
- Designed to run fully inside a Docker container but can also be run outside of an UNRAID context as well
- Codebase is stable and mature; no significant changes in the foreseeable future
- Looks neat imho üëç
  - (note: the layout is not configurable! sorry about that)

## Hardware Setup and Wiring
Assuming you actually want to physically replicate this yourself, wire up the components as follows:
<div align="center">
    
| ILI9341 | FT232 |
| --- | --- |
| VCC | 5V |
| GND | GND |
| CS | C0 |
| RESET | C2 |
| DC | C1 |
| MOSI | D1 |
| SLK | D0 |
| LED | 3V |
| MISO | D2 |
    
</div>
Once cobbled together, connect the FT232 board to an available USB port or header on your computer.

## Software Setup
### Prerequisites
- UNRAID
<br>

--- or ---
- Python 3.9 or newer
- A working internet connection
- Your preferred flavor of Linux (only tested in Debian so far)
  - Requires `apt` as the package manager
  - Requires `sudo` permissions (as we are interfacing directly with hardware)

### Running on UNRAID

#### Getting set up
*This guide assumes you have the [Dynamix File Manager plugin](https://forums.unraid.net/topic/120982-dynamix-file-manager/) installed, or you're running UNRAID 7+.*
1. On a separate computer, go to [this project's Tags](https://github.com/WeegeeNumbuh1/UNRAID_status-screen/tags) and under the latest Tag, click the `zip` link to download the latest files.
2. Extract the downloaded zip file's contents.
3. Open the UNRAID GUI.
4. In the Shares tab, open the `appdata` folder by pressing the arrow pointing out of the box at the far left.
5. Press the Create button at the bottom, and create a new folder named `status-screen`. In the pop-up, press the Start button to make the folder.
6. Navigate to `status-screen`.
7. Press the Upload button and select all the files & folders extracted from Step 2.
8. Make sure the [`init.sh`](/init.sh), [`main.py`](/main.py), and [`settings.yaml`](/settings.yaml) files are in that folder and that they are not inside another folder.
9. Press the Done button at the bottom.

#### Setting up the Docker
10. Navigate to the Main tab.
11. Under the Boot Device section, press the arrow pointing out of the box next to `Flash`.
12. Navigate to `config/plugins/dockerMan/templates-user`.
13. Press the Upload button, and navigate to where the files were extracted in Step 2. In the `docker-config` folder, there should be a `my-UNRAID_status-screen.xml` file. Select that file to upload.
14. Press the Done button at the bottom.
15. Navigate to the Docker tab.
16. Press the "Add Container" button.
17. Under `Template`, `UNRAID_status-screen` should appear. Select it.
18. The fields should auto-populate.
19. Under the `Script Source` option, make sure it says `/mnt/user/appdata/status-screen` and edit it if it doesn't match.
20. Press the Apply button. The Docker will begin building and run.
<br />

If the Docker is configured correctly, it will execute the `init.sh` script and should start monitoring your system.
<br />
Check the Docker log for script output.

#### Updating to the latest version
Follow steps 1-4 and step 6 above. Then:
1. Shutdown the Docker.
2. Delete `init.sh` and `main.py`.
3. Upload these same files from the files you extracted from the latest release.
4. Restart the Docker.

### Running outside of UNRAID
If running outside of UNRAID (eg. a Raspberry Pi):
```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/WeegeeNumbuh1/UNRAID_status-screen
sudo bash UNRAID_status-screen/init-portable.sh
```
The script will create its own virtual Python environment and do what is needed to run.

<details><summary>For Windows users:</summary>

No support. Likely will not run.<br>
[`UNRAID-screen.py`](./test/UNRAID-screen.py) will work, but assumes you're using VSCode + Juptyer. Also YMMV. You've been warned.
</details>

### Settings
The [`settings.yaml`](./settings.yaml) file has comments built-in that explain all the user-adjustable options that can be configured. Refer to that file for details. Any changes require the Docker or the script restarted to take effect.
> [!NOTE]
> The script has fallbacks for environment settings like `CPU_TEMP_SENSOR` and `NETWORK_INTERFACE` in case they can't be found, and will list out all available sensors when this happens so that you can correct it in the `settings.yaml` file for next time.

> [!TIP]
>The script expects there to be a [`background.bmp`](/Reference%20Images/background.bmp) or an equivalent `240 x 320` resolution image as a splash image placed in the working directory. This image is shown when first loading and left on the screen once the script is terminated until power is disconnected. The splash image is optional but is recommended.

## Version History
Refer to [`Changelog.txt`](./Changelog.txt).

## Roadmap
- [ ] ~~Figure out blitting with `matplotlib` for significant plot generation speedup~~
- [ ] ~~Figure out how to make the screen rendering routine work faster~~
    - [ ] ~~Use multiple cores? Use a GPU library? Who knows... *(might never happen)*~~
- [x] Works good enough ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/389287695903621121.webp?size=20)
